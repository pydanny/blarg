# Resolutions for 2023

## Continue to work on saving the planet

Since November of 2020 I've been at Octopus Energy using my skills and talent to address climate change. I plan to continue that effort. You can read my thoughts on why I'm so dedicated to our mission [here](/tags/octopus).

## Continue my fitness journey

In 2022 I joined a VR Beat Saber club and started going to a chiropractor. These helped a shoulder injury recover enough for me to start weightlifting and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu again. I want to continue and fit in my old clothes again.

In 2023 I plan to continue my fitness journey.

## Publish at least book

Last I published a new book was 2020. Be it fiction or non-fiction I want to put out a new book.

## Compete in a hackathon

The last I participated in a hackathon was 2021. I love the feeling of competition and drive to launch fast. I'm hoping to have the opportunity to compete in 2023.

## Go someplace new

Be it here in Southern California, another state, or even another country, I want to explore someplace new. I'm hoping to go to the Grand Canyon in 2023 but I'll take anything.

## Learn new things

I'm of the opinion that if you're not learning, you're career is ending. I want to continue to learn new things. In 2023 I plan to learn more about Python, Rust, and JavaScript. While I'm at it, I want to deepen my BJJ knowledge.

## Be a good parent

Going into my daughter's 4th year I rededicate myself toward being a good father.
