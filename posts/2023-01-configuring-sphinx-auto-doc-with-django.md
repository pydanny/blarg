How to make it so projects with Django as a dependency benefit from Sphinx's auto-documentation features.

# The Problems

I want to be able to document open source packages with Sphinx (ex. [xocto](https://github.com/octoenergy/xocto)) and have Sphinx automatically document the Django helpers. This isn't quite the same as documenting a Django project, so I wasn't sure if the otherwise awesome [sphinxcontrib-django](https://sphinxcontrib-django.readthedocs.io/) would be the right tool. Fortunately, there's a solution that doesn't require any additional packages.

# The Solution

## Configuration

First, in the Sphinx docs folder, create a file called `django_settings.py` and add the following:

```python
"""
Minimal file so Sphinx can work with Django for autodocumenting.

Location: /docs/django_settings.py
"""

# INSTALLED_APPS with these apps is necessary for Sphinx to build
# without warnings & errors
# Depending on your package, the list of apps may be different
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
]
```

Next, at the top of Sphinx's `conf.py`, add the following:

```python
# docs/conf.py
import os
import sys

import django

# Note: You may need to change the path to match
# your project's structure
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(".."))  # For discovery of Python modules
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("."))  # For finding the django_settings.py file

# This tells Django where to find the settings file
os.environ["DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"] = "django_settings"
# This activates Django and makes it possible for Sphinx to
# autodoc your project
django.setup()
```

## Usage

In one of your documentation files, perhaps `docs/localtime.rst`:

```plaintext

.. automodule:: xocto.localtime
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
```

Or if you are using [myst-parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/) to use Markdown with Sphinx. In this case, the file would be at `docs/localtime.md`:

````markdown
```{eval-rst}
.. automodule:: xocto.localtime
  :members:
  :undoc-members:
  :show-inheritance:
```
````
